# spring-training
This repository contains slides of a Spring training course with exercises.
Solutions for these exercises are also provided.
It must be pointed out that these solutions are naive ones. The intent of an exercise is to practice a Spring functionality, not to build a complete Java program which covers all possible error cases.
