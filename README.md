# spring-training
This repository contains slides (in french) of a Spring training course with exercises and code examples.
Solutions for these exercises are also provided.
It must be pointed out that these solutions are naive ones. The intent of an exercise is to practice a Spring functionality, not to build a complete Java program which covers all possible error cases.
Some exercises need an RDBMS to work.

The Spring topics covered are :
    * Spring Dependency Injection
    * Spring MVC
    * Spring Data (with focus on JPA repositories)
    * Spring Resources
    * SPring AOP (only basic information)
    * Spring REST (very partially, as it lacks a proper introduction to REST).
The corresponding slides should be read in this order, starting with "Spring - Introduction" of course.

Files are organized this way.
The directory "training" contains all but exercise slides. These exercice slides are placed in "Exercises/slides" subdirectory.
Solutions to exercices can be found in directory "exercices/sources".
The slides in file "training/Examples - description.pdf" describe the various examples. They highlight what is of interest in each example. Source code of the examples are in subdirectory "examples".

Hope this helps !
